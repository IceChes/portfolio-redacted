    <div class="project-text">
        <p>When I started getting more into combat robotics, I wanted to make a more serious robot to test my hardware.
            Reflection was a mostly-unsuccessful attempt to meet this need.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-text">
        <p>Reflection went through three major iterations. The first could barely drive due to center of mass issues.
            The second violently exploded during a fight. The third was plagued by radio issues.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-text">
        <p>Each iteration did improve on the last, but only marginally. Some of the good ideas from the project included
            titanium armor plates, aluminum weapon uprights, and an innovative motor mounting technique making use of
            the robot's lid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-text">
        <p> One important development was using a multi-material 3D printer to print parts of the
            chassis in different materials. The main chassis body was made of TPU for impact resistance, but certain
            areas like screw bosses and side plates were made of PETG for rigidity and resistance.</p>
