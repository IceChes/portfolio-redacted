    <div class="project-text">
        <p>Foundation was my first major project in the 3D printing sphere. In the fall of my first year of high school
            I decided I was ready to design my own machine. I wanted something fast and novel that would make a
            statement. Foundation was equipped with double Y-axis motors, a high-flow hotend, and other high-speed
            fixings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-text">
        <p>Without knowledge of proper design practices, however, Foundation had plenty of intermittent failures. The
            motion system and extrusion system were never quite up to par, and the print speed was never quite where I
            wanted it. One day, I printed the first Unicross parts on it and then took it apart permanently.</p>
