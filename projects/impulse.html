    <h3>A better OSHW combat robot drive controller.</h3>

        <p>Combat robots are messy and expensive. The goal of Impulse is to control the chaos and cost of 1lb
            combat robots in the area of brushed drive control. One Impulse driver costs around $10 and communicates
            over serial
            to a bespoke receiver. It is approximately 25x15mm, fitting neatly into tiny combat robot enclosures.</p>

    <div class="project-text">
        <p>Impulse is the result of multiple iterations in an attempt to improve the archaic tech usually used to drive
            brushed motors in combat robots. While the first versions were large and used equally-old tech, Impulse is
            fitted with a recent microprocessor, short-circuit protection, and a snap-fit connector, features that
            should be baseline at this point. Throughout the project I learned how to design circuit boards and power
            systems as well as how to program more obscure chips and design my own tests and development processes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-text">
        <p>The end goal of Impulse is to be a part of a control system which can compensate for the natural forces of
            combat to make driving easier. It is a first step to a smarter generation of combat robots.</p>
